Setup
------

Before running this, you need to create a file "config/config.json", where the content is:

{
    "uname": "dbuser",
    "pwd": "{your password}"
}

It is the credential to mongoDB. In config/index.js, it shows the connection string to mongodb in the cloud, you can change this to a mongodb on your local

About
-----
This is a simple todo app, that i created based on 2 Udemy courses. which are
a. 
b.

Flow
----
The Logic for the API is in: controllers/main.js
The REST API definition is in: routes/main.js

To add todo, you need to be authenticated, which JWT is used. When a call is made to API (check routes), this is the Flow
- > routes/main.js -> middleware/auth.js -> controllers/main.js
So all checks for auth is handle by this middleware, it validate the claims in the JWT token and then sends the claim to the controller.

Error  handling
---------------
controller can simply throw error, and the custom-error.js will handling setting the http code to send back to user.

Planning for app
----------------

1. to add roles for user (admin, user) so admin user can call api that 
- gives ALL todo task
- views all users
- allows deletion of todo or users

2. to implement hash for password

3. implement a simple client side that consumes the API
